# MFC-DX11-D2D

Sample showing how to integrate DirectX 11, Direct2D and DirectWrite into a multi-view MFC application. The sample is loosely based on an older [Frank Luna](http://www.d3dcoder.net/default.htm) sample that integrated DirectX 9 with MFC.

The software was built using [Visual Studio 2019 community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (be sure to install the MFC module).
